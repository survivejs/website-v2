Summer is a great time to travel and see new places. So far I've scheduled three events for the Summer although more may appear depending on the public interest.

## GrazJS - 06-07.06.2018

The first event where I'll take part this Summer is [GrazJS meetup on 6th of June](https://www.meetup.com/grazjs/events/249491912/). We'll do [workshops on 7th](https://reactvienna-workshops-styria.now.sh/) so if you are interested in either ReasonML, design systems, or webpack, this is your chance to get a deep dive into the topic.

## JIMDO Dev Talks - 28.06.2018

I will be going to Hamburg on 28th of June to participate in [JIMDO Dev Talks](https://www.meetup.com/JIMDO-Dev-Talks/events/251172433/?eventId=251172433) event as a guest speaker.

## JSCamp Barcelona - 18-20.07.2018

I will go to [JSCamp Barcelona](https://jscamp.tech/) in July. You can [get -10% off if you use my promocode](https://ti.to/jscamp/jscamp-barcelona-2018/discount/SURVIVEJS).

## Conclusion

The Summer is shaping up nicely and more events might come up. It's likely we'll organize local events especially in the context of [React Vienna](https://www.meetup.com/ReactVienna/).

I'm currently in process of splitting up the big book ([SurviveJS - Webpack and React](https://leanpub.com/survivejs_webpack_react)). The split allows me to dig deeper in both topics. This book, [SurviveJS - Webpack](https://leanpub.com/survivejs-webpack), focuses on webpack as you might guess.

Given this is the very first edition, you can expect some rough spots. Some interesting topics are missing as well, but you have to start from somewhere.

## Release Notes

* There's an [online edition](/webpack/preface). It contains the same content as the commercial version. I am just experimenting with a little different model here for a change to see how it goes.
* If you have bought "SurviveJS - Webpack and React", you will receive this book for free once I complete the split. That book will become simply "SurviveJS - React". This will give me room to develop more React specific content.
* A part of this books profit (around ~30%) will go to Tobias Koppers, the author of webpack. This book simply wouldn't be possible without him so he more than deserves a cut.
* Feedback is welcome. Prefer [the GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/survivejs/webpack/issues) for that. You can reach me other ways too. I am particularly interested in what sort of content to develop.

## Conclusion

I hope you enjoy the book. If you have read the original one, you probably won't find a lot of new content here. I feel the content is easier to access, though, and there are some nuggets of information you just might not be aware of yet.

If you want to support the development of the book, [pick up a copy at Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/survivejs-webpack).

Till the next release! It's time to refresh the big one.
